              We're dedicated to giving you the very best of college events,
              with a focus on the Panamanian cultural diversity, Founded in 2019
              by Hortensia Almanza, Kaelyn Moreno, and Yosep Almanza, PANAS has
              come a long way from its beginnings in the University of Southern
              Indiana. Their passion for sharing the Panamanian culture with the
              USI community and providing a place for Panamanian Students to get
              involved and explore their interest in a unique and fun way on
              campus drove them into the idea of creating an organization. In
              Fall of 2019, they turned their passion, inspiration, and hard
              work into the Panamanian Association, which is also called by its
              acronym PANAS, meaning “Friends” for most Latin-American
              countries, including Panama. Thanks to Hortensia, Yosep, and
              Kaelyn, our founders, we officially started in the Fall 2019
              session, participating in the Student Involvement Fair as our
              first activity, and won one "Organization of the Month" award in
              our first year! More than learning other's culture, the Panamanian
              Association at USI give students the opportunity to practice
              Spanish, participate in activities as DIYs, soccer games, game
              nights, dancing, and much more.
